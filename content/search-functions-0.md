To make it easier to search and find interesting emails, we have created a [search](https://totalemail.io/search) capability that allows you to use search functions. The idea of search functions is that they allow you to make a query more precise. For example, if you are looking for emails containing the domain name `ocn.ne.jp`, you can search for "[ocn.ne.jp](https://totalemail.io/search?q=ocn.ne.jp)", but this may return results where `ocn.ne.jp` is not a domain name. To view only emails where `ocn.ne.jp` is a domain name, you can use "[dom(ocn.ne.jp)](https://totalemail.io/search?q=dom%28ocn.ne.jp%29)". If you want to be even more specific, however, and only want to see emails containing the domain name `ocn.ne.jp` in the header, you can use "[domh(ocn.ne.jp)](https://totalemail.io/search?q=dom%28ocn.ne.jp%29)". To view emails containing the domain name `ocn.ne.jp` in a body, you can use "[domb(ocn.ne.jp)](https://totalemail.io/search?q=domb%28ocn.ne.jp%29)".
