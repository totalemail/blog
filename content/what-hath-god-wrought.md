#### Why: Our Objective

TotalEmail exists to help you determine whether or not an email is malicious, [spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spam), or just a benign, [cold email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_email) (or something else entirely).

#### How: Our Criteria for Success

We would like to accomplish our objective in a way that:

- Is **accessible** for users with vastly different levels of expertise
    - We want TotalEmail to be approachable enough that an individual with only basic knowledge of email, the internet, and computers can find value from it and deep enough that seasoned cyber-security professionals can derive great value from it.
- Is **easy** (perhaps even enjoyable) to use
- Has **good interfaces** (both programmatic and graphical)
- **Facilitates others**
    - Our goal in building TotalEmail is to provide a system that creates ideas in other people and facilitates the create of new and effective solutions.

We are excited to be embarking on this endeavor and are encouraged that you took the time to read this! This is the start of something great!
