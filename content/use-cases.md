TotalEmail exists to help you identify if an email is malicious; here are some ideas to get you thinking about how you can use TotalEmail. If you have questions about any of the use-cases below, please <a href="mailto:info@totalemail.io">email us</a>. You can learn more about why TotalEmail exists [here](/what-hath-god-wrought/).

#### Use-case 1: Train Spam Detection Systems

Some spam detection systems require some training to fine-tune their accuracy. TotalEmail is a great resource for finding malicious (and non-malicious) emails which you can use to train other spam detection systems.

#### Use-case 2: Investigate Suspicious Emails

An obvious use-case is to [analyze suspicious emails](https://totalemail.io/) with TotalEmail. Just upload or paste the content of the email and see what TotalEmail can identify about that email!

#### Use-case 3: Develop/Test New Spam Detection Systems

If you have an idea for developing novel spam detection methods, we'd love to facilitate your research! We can do this by providing you with datasets to test and train your system and/or by even running your new spam detection system as one of our analysis engines.

If you're a computer science teacher and are teaching a class in which students write their own spam detection system, we'd be happy to help you as well.

#### Use-case 4: Use TotalEmail In-line

With [TotalEmail's API](https://docs.totalemail.io/), it is possible to use TotalEmail to provide in-line analysis for incoming emails.

#### Use-case 5: Train End-Users (Use TotalEmail as Part of User Training)

You can also use TotalEmail as part of a user training program to help end-users identify if an email is suspicious or malicious. For example, in your training curriculum, you can show users how to use TotalEmail to submit an email and interpret the results. This way, you can provide them with a simple, approachable way to determine if an email is malicious.
