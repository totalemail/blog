We are going to be naming our minor releases based on [constellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU_designated_constellations). We'll also publish a blog for every minor release detailing some of the significant (and fun) features we've added and where will be going next. All of our blog posts about releases will be tagged "[Release Notes](/tags/release-notes/)".

Each blog post on a release will include:

- **Why we did it**: our objectives in this release and how it fits into our overarching objective
- **What we did**: what we accomplished in this release
- **How we did it**: a technical look at how we accomplished our goals

Enjoy and [happy hunting](https://alpha.totalemail.io/email/2dc687010f612dc4d2393895f748acd8a523d69d65090c7c1345a1eafca22c81)!
